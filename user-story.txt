// The user is greeted with a welcome screen that includes
// an opening message, image, and a "Start" button that 
// launches the quiz.

// The quiz then begins and displays the question number and
// current score at the top, followed by the question and 
// four answer choices with radio buttons as inputs. A submit
// button is at the bottom of the screen.

// A correct answer should generate a screen with a message indicating
// the user is correct, a celebratory image, a feedback message, and 
// a button that allows the user to proceed to the next question.

// An incorrect message should generate a screen with a message 
// indicating the user is incorrect, a negative image, a feedback 
// message stating the correct answer, and a button that allows the 
// user to proceed to the next question.

// After answer all questions and passing (greater than half correct), 
// the user is greeted with a celebratory message, a celebratory image,
// their score, and a button to restart the quiz from the first question.

// After answer all questions and failing (less than half correct), 
// the user is greeted with a negative message, a negative image, 
// their score, and a button to restart the quiz from the first question.
